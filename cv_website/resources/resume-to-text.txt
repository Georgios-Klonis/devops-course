Summary
I have always been interested in mathematics, algorithms and physics, while being a competitive person. Today, I am studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (BCSAI) in IE University in Spain, while having a High Potential Award scholarship.
I started learning to code at the very young age of 12 years old, participating in National Robotics competitions, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. The first year of high school, was when I really got into coding and I realised software engineering was the right field for me. Since then, I have been practicing by myself, creating projects and with my robotics team. We have achieved a lot, such as many 1st place awards in the national Robotics competition and won the 1st place Startup Idea Award on the Word Robot Olympiad 2022.
I am familiar with a variety of programming languages, including Python, C, Swift/SwiftUI, PHP and SQL but I am always adding new skills to my repertoire.
